  <p>This is a 23 year old that fights negativity and mental illness. She knows how important
    the mind is and being at peace with yourself. She was bullied before and had alot
    of negative people around her. She ended up almost losing herself. Until she started to do
    things she enjoyed. Which eventually led to happiness and positivity. That's when she realize
    other people go through bullies and have negative people in their life. So she swore
    to help those who use to be like her. When she is non fighting she motivates,
    uplift people, and push positive thoughts to the mind.</p>
